  abstract = {Communication Systems Engineering, 2nd edition, offers comprehensive coverage of the basic principles in the analysis and design of modern communication systems, and review of important mathematical foundation topics. It is primarily intended for use as a text for a first course in communications, or as a comprehensive reference for practicing engineers.

This new edition of Communication Systems Engineering exposes the reader to relevant topics from digital communication system principles including, source coding, channel coding, baseband and carrier modulation, channel distortion, channel equalization, synchronization, and wireless communications.

New content changes for the second edition include:

    * Coverage of the JPEG standard for image compression;
    * Coverage Of OFDM and multicarrier modulation;
    * Coverage of Turbo codes, product codes, the BCJR algorithm, and iterative codes
    * A chapter on wireless communications (including new material on GSM and the IS-95 CDMA standard, as well as multiple antenna systems and space-time codes)

    * Introduction
    * Frequency Domain Analysis of Signals and Systems
    * Analog Signal Transmission and Reception
    * Random Processes
    * Effect of Noise on Analog Communication Systems
    * Information Sources and Source Coding
    * Digital Transmission Through the Additive White Gaussian Noise Channel
    * Digital Transmission Through Bandlimited AWGN Channels
    * Channel Capacity and Coding
    * Wireless Communications
